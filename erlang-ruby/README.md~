# erlang-ports
Common place to drop code related with Erlang ports.

# erlang-ruby
Toy project to test the interaction between Erlang and Ruby processes.

## Setup
```
cd erlang-ruby
bundle install
```

## Usage
You will need to open two terminals.  In the first one, open an erlang console and run the following:

```erlang
1> c(server).
{ok,server}
2> P = server:start().
#Port<0.2323>
3> server:send(P, {test}).
true
```

In the second console, do the following:

```bash
tail -f /tmp/test.log
```

You should be able to see the terms you sent from Erlang to the running Ruby process in that log.  The ruby process is running `client.rb` script.
